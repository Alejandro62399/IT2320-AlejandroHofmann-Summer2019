<question id="question1">Describe the purpose of AJAX. What advantage does AJAX provide over a traditional HTML form submit
<answer>
    The purpose of AJAX is to enable asynchronous function calls within an browser to the back end web server without having to reload the entire page.
    In traditional HTML, at every form submit or postback, the entire page gets submitted which gives a feeling of the
    entire page flickering or refreshing. While in AJAX only the HTML section that is configured for asynchronous call gets a flickering feeling because thats the
    only section that gets submitted back to web server.

<question id="question2">Describe the role of JSON and XML with AJAX
<answer>
      JSON and XML are both programming languages, but more specifically,  simple structured text data that can be passed as a simple string to
      any program with ease. The uses of JSON and XML with AJAX are independent of the database. For Ajax implementation like jQuery, it becomes easier
      once the data is available in such simple formats. It does not have the overload of connecting to secure databases in the backend, and it frees
      the back end and lets the front end work more smoothly by limiting to only show the data that is desired.

<question id="question3">If you had to choose just one, which would you choose: XML or JSON? Why?
<answer>
  
    I would choose JSON over XML because JSON works well with Javascript languages including jQuery. I think that it working well with Javascript is important because
    most browser client side scripts are javascript based.
